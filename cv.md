## Briefly About Myself:


My career started ten years ago in a big company as a computer engeneer. After a few years in this  position and maternity leave 
I began to teach computer science to children. Then I left my main job as a computer engeneer and became a  full-time tutor.
Today I've been working as a computer science tutor for schoolchildren for over 3 years.
And I'm really into proggramming. That's why I want to become a front-end developer. 
I'm open to new knowledge, I like to study new technologies and apply them in practice. 
And I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will allow me to become an experienced Frontend Developer.
